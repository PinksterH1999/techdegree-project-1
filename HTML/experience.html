            <h2>My experience with Treehouse</h2>
            <p>
                I have been using Treehouse for a week now and I’m loving everything about it. 
                The courses have a great structure and the teachers are good. 
                The way tracks work is also great for learning about multiple programming languages, for example the front-end web development track. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m also being stimulated by the progress system after each video or course, because I found myself doing one to five more videos or quizzes a day. 
                This has led to a quick completion of the courses needed for the first project.

            <h2>My experience with other learning platforms</h2>
            <p>
                    My experience with codecademy and khancademy was way different. 
                    I wasn’t being stimulated by some sort of progress system and the way of learning was bad. 
                    The things you learned did not stick around and this resulted in partially learning the language.
